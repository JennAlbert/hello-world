<h4> Jennifer Albert </h4>
I live in <em><strong>Lexington, KY</strong></em>
<p>I have been wanting to learn how to code for a long time. I learned some HTML back in high school in the ninth grade. <br>
  After that, I learned some Visual Basic when I was a senior. I didn't do anything with code for years but at my current job we use Visual Basic a lot. </p>
  <p>Here are some things about me:</p>
